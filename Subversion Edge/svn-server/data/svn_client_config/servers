###                              connections.
###   http-bulk-updates          Whether to request bulk update
###                              responses or to fetch each file
###                              in an individual request.
###   store-passwords            Specifies whether passwords used
###                              to authenticate against a
###                              Subversion server may be cached
###                              to disk in any way.
###   store-plaintext-passwords  Specifies whether passwords may
###                              be cached on disk unencrypted.
###   store-ssl-client-cert-pp   Specifies whether passphrase used
###                              to authenticate against a client
###                              certificate may be cached to disk
###                              in any way
###   store-ssl-client-cert-pp-plaintext
###                              Specifies whether client cert
###                              passphrases may be cached on disk
###                              unencrypted (i.e., as plaintext).
###   store-auth-creds           Specifies whether any auth info
###                              (passwords, server certs, etc.)
###                              may be cached to disk.
###   username                   Specifies the default username.
###
### Set store-passwords to 'no' to avoid storing passwords on disk
### in any way, including in password stores.  It defaults to
### 'yes', but Subversion will never save your password to disk in
### plaintext unless explicitly configured to do so.
### Note that this option only prevents saving of *new* passwords;
### it doesn't invalidate existing passwords.  (To do that, remove
### the cache files by hand as described in the Subversion book.)
###
### Set store-plaintext-passwords to 'no' to avoid storing
### passwords in unencrypted form in the auth/ area of your config
### directory. Set it to 'yes' to allow Subversion to store
### unencrypted passwords in the auth/ area.  The default is
### 'ask', which means that Subversion will ask you before
### saving a password to disk in unencrypted form.  Note that
### this option has no effect if either 'store-passwords' or
### 'store-auth-creds' is set to 'no'.
###
### Set store-ssl-client-cert-pp to 'no' to avoid storing ssl
### client certificate passphrases in the auth/ area of your
### config directory.  It defaults to 'yes', but Subversion will
### never save your passphrase to disk in plaintext unless
### explicitly configured to do so.
###
### Note store-ssl-client-cert-pp only prevents the saving of *new*
### passphrases; it doesn't invalidate existing passphrases.  To do
### that, remove the cache files by hand as described in the
### Subversion book at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/\
###                    svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html\
###                    #svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache
###
### Set store-ssl-client-cert-pp-plaintext to 'no' to avoid storing
### passphrases in unencrypted form in the auth/ area of your
### config directory.  Set it to 'yes' to allow Subversion to
### store unencrypted passphrases in the auth/ area.  The default
### is 'ask', which means that Subversion will prompt before
### saving a passphrase to disk in unencrypted form.  Note that
### this option has no effect if either 'store-auth-creds' or
### 'store-ssl-client-cert-pp' is set to 'no'.
###
### Set store-auth-creds to 'no' to avoid storing any Subversion
### credentials in the auth/ area of your config directory.
### Note that this includes SSL server certificates.
### It defaults to 'yes'.  Note that this option only prevents
### saving of *new* credentials;  it doesn't invalidate existing
### caches.  (To do that, remove the cache files by hand.)
###
### HTTP timeouts, if given, are specified in seconds.  A timeout
### of 0, i.e. zero, causes a builtin default to be used.
###
### Most users will not need to explicitly set the http-library
### option, but valid values for the option include:
###    'serf': Serf-based module (Subversion 1.5 - present)
###    'neon': Neon-based module (Subversion 1.0 - 1.7)
### Availability of these modules may depend on your specific
### Subversion distribution.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended only to
### demonstrate how to use this file; any resemblance to actual
### servers, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.
