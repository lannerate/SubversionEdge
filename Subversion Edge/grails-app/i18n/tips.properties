# Tips for the System Administration Screens
#
tip.admin.1=Do you have multiple Subversion Edge servers in your organization? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> them to TeamForge and they can all be controlled and managed from a single web-based user interface.
tip.admin.2=If your server needs to go through a proxy to reach the Internet be sure to <a href="/csvn/server/editProxy">configure your proxy server</a> so that Subversion Edge can check for and retrieve updates.
tip.admin.3=Configuring LDAP can be difficult. Be sure to read the <a target="_blank" href="https://ctf.open.collab.net/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.svnedge/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions"> LDAP section of the FAQ</a> for tips and troubleshooting techniques.
tip.admin.4=Once your repositories are backed up to the CollabNet Cloud, they are additionally backed up according to the same procedures as all of our cloud hosted customers. So you never have to worry about losing your valuable source code assets. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collab.net/products/subversion/cloudbackup">Read more</a>
tip.admin.5=Do you need an issue tracker, agile planning tool or wiki? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collab.net/products/teamforge"> More information ...</a>
tip.admin.6=Subversion Edge makes it easy to configure and manage a Subversion server. Want something even easier? Sign up for <a href="/csvn/setupCloudServices/index">CollabNet Cloud Services</a> and let someone else manage your development servers. Once you are in the cloud you can easily add additional tools like Scrumworks Pro or even git.
tip.admin.7=Configure your <a href="/csvn/server/editMail"> Mail Server information</a> so that Subversion Edge can email you when background jobs have completed or to inform you of any errors in those jobs.
tip.admin.8=Are you considering agile or running any agile projects already? Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collab.net/products/scrumworks">Scrumworks Pro</a> for an easy to use agile management tool.
tip.admin.9=One of the best features Subversion Edge provides is automatic log rotation. Be sure to <a href="/csvn/log/configure">configure the number of log files to keep</a> so that your server disk does not fill up with log files.
tip.admin.10=Need help configuring or managing your Subversion environment? CollabNet provides support, training and services. <a href="/csvn/ocn/index">Learn more on the Extensions page</a>.
tip.admin.11=You should periodically backup your Subversion Edge data folder so that you have a backup of your database and other configuration files that are managed by Subversion Edge.
tip.admin.12=Are you supporting a large geographically distributed team across slow WAN links? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge and you can use their combined support for Subversion replicas and proxies. Drop a Subversion Edge proxy in the LAN of your remote team and they will get fast read access to their repositories, but still be governed by the access control model defined in TeamForge.
tip.admin.13=Have you signed up for your <a href="/csvn/setupCloudServices/index">free Cloud Services account</a> yet? You can backup up to 250 MB of repository data for free. Pricing plans are available if you need more space.
tip.admin.14=You only need to create user accounts for built-in users. If using LDAP, your users are created and managed by your LDAP server, such as Windows Active Directory. Users can login to the console with their LDAP credentials and that will create a "user placeholder" account to which you can assign administrator roles if desired.
tip.admin.15=Want to delegate administrative functionality in a more fine-grained manner? <br /> <br /> <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collab.net/products/teamforge">TeamForge</a> -- which introduces the concept of projects. A user can be an administrator for one project and not even be able to see that other projects exist.
tip.admin.16=<a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">TeamForge</a> extends Subversion access control to include wildcard characters in path-based access rules. This allows you to define a rule for a path like /**/secure and have it apply to all folders named "secure" anywhere they exist in your repository.
tip.admin.17=Ever wanted to search the content of your repositories? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge, and get access to this feature and many others.
tip.admin.18=<a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> your server to TeamForge and gain access to additional features that it provides, such as integrated Code Review using either a pre or post-commit review workflow.
tip.admin.19=Consider <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">connecting</a> your Subversion Edge server to TeamForge for enhanced permissions management functionality. TeamForge provides Role-Based Access Control model that allows you to delegate permissions management to project teams. In addition, TeamForge supports wildcards in path-based permissions and provides a web-based GUI for configuring the permissions assigned to a role.
tip.admin.20=Want to add additional Subversion features like Code Search, Code Review, Analytics or enhanced permissions management? <br /> <br /> <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index">Connect</a> Subversion Edge to TeamForge. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collab.net/products/teamforge/capabilities"> More information ...</a>
tip.admin.21=Looking for Subversion-specific reports, such as commit activity? <a href="/csvn/setupTeamForge/index"> Connect to TeamForge</a> and get reports on your Subversion activity as well as additional functionality such as code search and code review.
#
# Tip keys can include the controller or even the controller plus action, which
# are discoverable via the URL pattern: /csvn/controller/action
# If more specific tips exist for a given controller or action, their chances
# of being shown are increased. But the more generic tips will still occasionally
# be shown even when more specific tips are available.  Tips can also be used 
# under more than one key using <alias>anotherTipKey</alias> for the value.
# This offers some advantage over simply repeating the values when localizing
# this file to other languages.

tip.admin.server.editAuthentication.1=<alias>tip.admin.3</alias>
tip.admin.server.editAuthentication.2=Using Active Directory? Try port number 3268 instead of the default LDAP port. This causes queries to go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc728188(v=ws.10).aspx">Active Directory Global Catalog</a>
tip.admin.server.editAuthentication.3=<alias>tip.admin.14</alias>

tip.admin.server.edit.1=<alias>tip.admin.6</alias>
tip.admin.server.edit.2=Edge makes it easy to use SSL to secure network traffic. You should turn on this feature and use it. See this <a target="_blank" href="https://ctf.open.collab.net/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.svnedge/wiki/SSL">wiki page</a> for information on using your own SSL certificates.

# Tips for the User Administration Screens
#
tip.adminUser.1=<alias>tip.admin.14</alias>
tip.adminUser.2=<alias>tip.admin.15</alias>
tip.adminUser.3=Delegate administration responsibilities to select users by adding them to one of the Administrator Roles. LDAP users can also be given adminstration rights. Just ask the user to login to the console and this will create a "LDAP User" account that you can then assign to the role.
tip.adminUser.4=Consider connecting your Subversion Edge server to TeamForge for enhanced permissions management functionality. TeamForge provides a Role-Based Access Control model that allows you to delegate permissions management to project teams.
tip.adminUser.5=Enter a valid email address for all user accounts (including the admin user) so that they can receive email notifications when jobs complete.

# Tips for the Repository Administration Screens
#
tip.adminRepo.1=<alias>tip.admin.8</alias>
tip.adminRepo.2=Are you supporting a large geographically distributed team across slow WAN links? Connect Subversion Edge to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.open.collab.net/products/ctf/">TeamForge</a> and you can use their combined support for Subversion replicas and proxies. Drop a Subversion Edge proxy in the LAN of your remote team and they will get fast read access to their repositories, but still be governed by the access control model defined in TeamForge.
tip.adminRepo.3=Do you use Subversion hook scripts? You can create repository templates that contain your standard hook scripts so that all new repositories you create have these hooks installed automatically.
tip.adminRepo.4=Consider connecting your Subversion Edge server to TeamForge for enhanced permissions management functionality. TeamForge provides a Role-Based Access Control model that allows you to delegate permissions management to project teams.
tip.adminRepo.5=Unsure if you should have one repository or many? <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.collab.net/subversion/2007/04/single_reposito/">Read this blog post</a>.
tip.adminRepo.6=Read this <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.collab.net/subversion/2007/04/subversion_repo/">blog post</a> for suggestions on how to layout the content of your repository.
tip.adminRepo.7=Create a new empty repository. Create your standard layout and configure the hook scripts. Then make a hotcopy backup of this repository. You can then use that backup to create a repository template. You can then create future repositories by selecting your template.
