NAME
     pkgrecv - image packaging system content retrieval utility

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgrecv [-s src_uri] [-d (path|dest_uri)] [-k] [-m] [-n] [-r]
         (fmri|pattern) ...

     /usr/bin/pkgrecv [-s src_uri] -n

DESCRIPTION
     pkgrecv allows the user to retrieve the contents of a package
     from a pkg(5) repository.  With the default options, the contents
     are retrieved in a format that can easily be input to pkgsend(1)
     when used with the 'include' subcommand.  As a result, pkgrecv(1)
     and pkgsend(1) can be used to conveniently modify and republish
     packages, perhaps by correcting file contents or providing
     additional package tags.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -d path_or_uri  The path of a directory to save the retrieved package
                     to, or the URI of a repository to republish it to.  If
                     not provided, the default value is the current working
                     directory.  If a directory path is provided, then
                     package content will only be retrieved if it does not
                     already exist in the target directory.  If a repository
                     URI is provided, a temporary directory will be created
                     and all of the package data retrieved before attempting
                     to republish it.

     -h              Display usage message.

     -k              Keep the retrieved package content compressed, ignored
                     when republishing.  Should not be used with pkgsend.

     -m match        Controls matching behaviour using the following values:
                         all-timestamps
                             includes all matching timestamps, not just
                             latest (implies all-versions)
                         all-versions
                             includes all matching versions, not just latest

     -n              List the most recent versions of the packages available
                     from the specified repository and exit (all other
                     options except -s will be ignored).

     -r              Recursively retrieves all dependencies for the provided
                     list of packages.

     -s src_repo_uri A URI representing the location of a pkg(5) repository
                     from which to receive package data.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  List newest packages available from the repository on
     the system named 'test'.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test -n
     pkg:/SUNWlibC@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T125720Z
     pkg:/SUNWfreetype2@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T123955Z
     pkg:/SUNWlibm@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T125728Z
     pkg:/SUNWliboil@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T125730Z

     Example 2: Receive the SUNWlibC, SUNWfreetype, and SUNWlibm
     packages from example 1.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test SUNWlibC@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T125720Z
     SUNWfreetype2@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T123955Z
     SUNWlibm@0.5.11,5.11-0.79:20080221T125728Z
     $ ls -d SUNW*
     SUNWfreetype2  SUNWlibC       SUNWlibm

     Example 3: Receive the package "SUNWvim" and all of its dependencies
     from the system named 'test'.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test -r SUNWvim

     Example 4: Receive all versions of the package "SUNWvim" from the
     system named 'test'.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test -m all-versions SUNWvim

     Example 5: Receive all versions of the package "SUNWvim" from the
     system named 'test' and republish it to a local repository.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test -d file:///local/repo SUNWvim

     Example 6: Receive all versions of the package "SUNWzlib" from the
     system named 'test' and republish it to a remote repository on the
     system named 'remote'.

     $ pkgrecv -s http://test -d http://remote:10000 SUNWzlib

     Example 7: Receive the package "SUNWemacs" and all of its dependencies
     from the repository located at '/var/pkg/repo'.

     $ pkgrecv -s file:///var/pkg/repo -r SUNWemacs
