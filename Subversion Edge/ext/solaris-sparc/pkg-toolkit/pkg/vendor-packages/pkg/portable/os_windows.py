Windows has a specific implementation for most of these.  For the
group and user id-related (credential) APIs, no implementation

utilize any credential metadata when acting on Windows-compatible

NTFS group mechanism if deemed useful.

# On Windows, rename to existing file is not allowed, so the
# destination file must be deleted first. But if the destination file 
# is locked, it cannot be deleted. Windows has 3 types of file locking
# 
# 1. Using share access controls that allow applications to specify 
#    whole-file access sharing for read, write or delete;
# 2. Using byte range locks to arbitrate read and write access to 
#    regions within a single file; and
# 3. By Windows file systems disallowing executing files from being 
#    opened for write or delete access.
#
# The code here deals only with locks of type 3. If the lock on the open 
# file is for a running executable, then the destination file can be renamed
# and deleted later when the file is no longer in use. For a rename to a 
# destination locked with type 1 or 2, rename throws an OSError exception.
#
# To accomplish the delayed delete, the file is renamed to a trash folder
# within the image containing the file. A single image is assumed to be 
# contained within a single file system, thus making the rename feasible. 
# The empty_trash method is called at the end of rename to cleanup any 
# trash files that were left from earlier calls to rename, typically by 
# previous processes. The empty_trash method needs to be fast most of the 
# time, so the real work is only done the first time a rename operation is 
# done on an image. The image module cannot be imported when this module is
# initialized because that leads to a circular dependency.  So it is imported
# as needed.
